Hello there. This is my first personal blog post :slightly_smiling_face:
Not much to see on this site yet. I'm currently looking for work in the video game industry as a developer.

I've worked in the IT industry as a software engineer for over 4 years. 
I've worked on front end websites and back end micro/macro services. I love automation and thinking about tests and test best practices.

Well, that's all for now :wave:
